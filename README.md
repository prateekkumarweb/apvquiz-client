### A Multiplayer Multithreaded Quizzing Application

APV Quiz is a quizzing application. Mulitple players connect to each other and quiz amongst themselves. Everyone gets the same set of questions and their scores are calculated based on the number of questions answered correctly and the time taken to answer them.

The application uses a server-client model, where all the players connect to a server, who can also be a client and play. This repository consists of the client side of the application written in C++.

This repository is to be used in conjunction with [apvquiz](https://github.com/prateekkumarweb/apvquiz)  which contains the implementation of the server side.
